# Notebook Descriptions:

## ReRank Notebook:
- The ReRank notebook explores the implementation of semantic search and re-ranking models to enhance the search functionality within a dataset of Wikipedia movie descriptions. It utilizes the Sentence Transformers library and CrossEncoder to achieve this task. The notebook also evaluates the performance of the models through various queries and computes metrics such as recall and mean reciprocal rank (MRR).

## Semantic Search Notebook:
- The Semantic Search notebook focuses on leveraging a pre-trained language model to perform semantic search within a dataset of Wikipedia movie descriptions. It utilizes the Sentence Transformers library to encode passages and queries, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant information. The notebook includes functions to evaluate recall and MRR for different search queries.

## RAG Notebook:
- The RAG notebook demonstrates the implementation of Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using Fireworks Fast Inference LLMs. It explores the combination of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge sources to enhance text generation capabilities. The notebook provides examples and explanations of RAG usage and its benefits.
